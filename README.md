### Overview  
* * *
This repository includes several hands on labs provided as a part of [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) course, offered by [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/).  

The present notebook provides data analysis on several datasets using different machine learning (ML) techniques including:
* Supervised ML
    * regression models
    * classification methods
        * K nearest neighbor
        * decision tree   
        * logistic regression
        * support vector machine (SVM)
* Unsupervised ML
    * clustering
        * partition-based method (k-mean)
        * hierarchical method (Agglomerative clustering)
        * density-based method (DSSCAN method)
* Recommender system
    * content based
    * collaborative based
