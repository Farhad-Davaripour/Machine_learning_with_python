### Overview
* * *
This hands on practice lab is a part of (Machine Learning with Python)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python] course, offered by [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/).  

The present notebook provides data analysis on several datasets using different machine learning (ML) techniques including:
* supervised ML
    * regression models
    * classification methods
        * K nearest neighbor
        * decision tree   
        * logistic regression
        * support vector machine (SVM)
* unsupervised ML
    * clustering
        * partition-based method (k-mean)
        * hierarchical method (Agglomerative clustering)
        * density-based method (DSSCAN method)
* recommender system
    * content based
    * collaborative based
